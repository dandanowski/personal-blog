Well, you clicked on the link so you must really want to know.

Orignally from Long Island, New York, I made my way through college in Upstate New York at Hartwick College and graduate with a degree in Geology. Naturally that led me to a career in web design. After graduating, I worked at Cornell University in various webmastery/web design roles before moving to Northern Ireland where I currently reside.

I am a husband, father of three kids, two cats, and a dog. I am a regular at the 6:30am CrossFit class in town three days a week and I coach 7-8 year olds rugby at the rugby club.

That's about as exciting as it gets personally.

Professionally, I've tried to keep my [CV](/s/cv) up to date and there is even a [portfolio](/s/portfolio).
