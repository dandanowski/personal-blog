Over the last 10 years I have focused mainly on enterprise web applications. When describing it this way, I have two main points in mind, often times the focus is on whoever is buying and not using and the bar for good usable design is quite low. The reality was it was a development lead setup. I ended up at AVEVA through acquisition of the small Derry-based company at which I was originally hired, 8over8. 

All of the designs shown were never intended to be standalone documentation as they supplemented the ongoing conversations about development of features. I had always initially walked development teams and stakeholders through the designs before allowing them access to the URLs for further review. 

## ProCon 

### Contract Risk Management software 

The product I spent most of my time on was ProCon, the sole product of 8over8. It serves as an audit of communication between a company that wants something built and the contract that was hired to build it. The target market is mega-capital projects where the costs exceed tens of millions of pounds. 

Over my time working on ProCon, I had brought it from database-on-a-screen interface to something that had a more considered approach to usability. 

### Feature work 

I have a select few feature prototypes that I can share. This is a limited set since not all of what I had worked on was presentable. Also shown is that I had experimented with different fidelities to get the audience to focus on the main purpose and no that there was a typo in some dummy text.

## Edge Management 

Once I was brought into AVEVA and into a larger design team with responsibility over a larger portfolio of products, I had the opportunity to work on other applications. Edge Management was another product that I was asked to work on. 

Edge Management is an administrative web interface for configuring and maintaining IoT edge devices that could run AVEVA software and be used where operational telemetry was to be pushed to the cloud for another of our products, Insight, to visualize for our customers. 

I had taken the project over about six months after it had started. There was an interface in place that I was trying to bring in line with the company design standards that we were starting to document at the time.

## AVEVA Design System 

The product suite in AVEVA has mostly come through acquisition. A by-product of this is that each product had made its own design decisions. Moving each product into the cloud and pushing the seamless transition between products only made this difference in visual design and UX even more apparent. Several years ago now, I had pushed for the UX team to create a common design system. This was and remains a large undertaking. To support this we have a dedicated team of a front end developer and dedicated tester, which I manage. 

Early on I made the decision to split the design system into three areas; UX guidance, visual alignment, use of common components. The idea was that we had over 150+ products of vastly different maturities and future investment. By aligning on UX guidance first, the product would follow similar user flows and pathways and feel like it was part of a larger suite. If development effort was allowed, the next phase would be to align visually. Again, different products had different technology stacks and we shouldn't be dictating how teams should build their products. Finally adopting a set of common components would future proof the application against any evolution in design or change in branding. 

To support the design system documentation, a website was built as well as plugin for Adobe XD. I decided to democratize the design process somewhat since lots of product managers were designing in PowerPoint anyway. We didn't need to be a bottleneck for the design process for the more straightforward user flows.
