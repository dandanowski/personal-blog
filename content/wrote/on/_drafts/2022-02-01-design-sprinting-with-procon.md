During my time at AVEVA, I focused mainly on enterprise web applications. When describing it this way, I have two main points in mind, oftentimes the focus is on whoever is buying and not using and the bar for good usable design is quite low. The reality was it was a development lead setup. We churned out features and rarely did we circle back for a second version.

### Contract Risk Management software
The product I spent most of my time on was ProCon, the sole product of 8over8. It served as an audit of communication between the company that wants something built and the contractor that was hired to build it. The target market is mega-capital projects where the costs exceed tens of millions of pounds and project overruns were upwards of 40%.
 
Over my time working on ProCon, I had brought it from database-on-a-screen interface design to something that had a more considered approach to usability. I had worked with each product owner to visualize features and get approval of product and development before any programming work began. I even introduced a design sprint ceremony into the agile discovery process. Inspired from the Google Design Sprint documentation, I applied different tasks depending on the problems to be solved.
