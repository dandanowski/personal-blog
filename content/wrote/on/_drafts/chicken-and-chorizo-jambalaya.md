A good chicken dinner with a little bit of spice that is good enough to keep the kids happy.

* Serves 2-3 people.
* 40 minutes
  * 20 min prep
  * 20 min cooking

# Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amt | Prepped |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chicken Breast | 500g | Cubed |
| Onion | 2 large | Diced |
| Red Bell Pepper | 1 large | Sliced |
| Chorizo | 75gm | Diced |
| Rice | 250g | |
| Chopped Tomatoes | 1 can | |
| Chicken Stock | 1 cube | Dissolved in 350ml boiling water |
| Cajun Seasoning | 1tbsp | |
| Boiling Water | 350ml | |
| Olive Oil | 4tbsp | |

# Steps

1. Put 2tbsp **Olive Oil** and cubed **Chicken Breasts** in a pot and heat until chicken cooked all the way through.
2. Take cooked **Chicken Breasts** out of pot and put to the side in a bowl.
3. Add diced **Onions** to the pot with 2tbsp **Olive Oil** and soften the **Onions**, they'll start to turn a little clear.
4. Add sliced **Red Bell Pepper**, **Chorizo**, and **Cajun Seasoning** and mix for 2-3 minutes.
5. Add **Rice**, whole can of **Chopped Tomatoes**, and **Chicken Stock** and mix well.
6. Let the temperature rise until simmering, then turn the heat to low and cover the pot.
7. Stir occasionally and let simmer for 20 minutes or until the **Rice** softens.

# Notes

* I like it spicier, so I add tabasco to my portion.
* My boys like to add southwest sauce, for a bit of smoky creaminess.
* My youngest doesn't like as much spice, so sour cream gets added to his.
