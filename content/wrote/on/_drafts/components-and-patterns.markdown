Like many, listening to Brad Frost talk about [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) was eye-opening for me. The concept of breaking down a design into its constituent parts that were reusable really resonated with me and changed how I approched designing digital products.

I must admit though, I have always had a hard time figuring out what the difference between a molecule and an organism is. Worse again was trying to communicate with any conviction those decisions. It seemed that I had to be the one to decide which bucket to put an element because I couldn't clearly communicate the rules. That's not a good way to work. As my friend Larry put it, if I won the lottery tomorrow, someone else will be making these decisions.

Starting with <abbr title="Global Savings Group">GSG</abbr> as the Design System Lead, I was meant to evolve their initial design system and make it scaleable across all of their products.
