The amateur American Football Club that I play for, the [Northwest Vipers](https://northwestvipers.com), is celebrating its tenth year as a club in 2024 and decided that it was time to change the name and tidy up its brand.

The club changed its name from the Donegal/Derry Vipers to the Northwest Vipers and took the opportunity to revision the logo as well. The original brand served the club well, but as it is a volunteer organization the consistency of the brand application slipped a bit. Additionally, it was difficult to track down the original logo. It was a case of the original file getting converted from one format to another and over time it did lose a bit of quality.

I had pitched two ideas after browsing through some Adobe Stock illustrations for some inspirations and it quickly gathered steam. As with most of my suggestions, I had pitched it as a conversation starter, but the conversation quickly ended. And, in a way, I'm glad. The rebranding of a club of volunteers is difficult especially when many of the founding members are involved. There is always an emotional attachment to these things, so I was relieved to see this go as smoothly as it had.

For the new logo, I was inspired by the the subtle 3D effect on the Netflix logo, the additional color detail help add a sense of quality to a logo with less fine shapes.
