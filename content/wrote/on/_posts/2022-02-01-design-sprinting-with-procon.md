Designing the right environment for the team to be creative, became just as important as being creative myself.

During my time at AVEVA, I focused mainly on enterprise web applications. When describing it this way, I have two main points in mind, oftentimes the focus is on whoever is buying and not using and the bar for good usable design is quite low. The reality was it was a development led setup. We churned out features and rarely did we circle back for a second version.

### Contract Risk Management software

The product I spent most of my time on was ProCon, the sole product of 8over8. It served as an audit of communication between the company that wants something built and the contractor that was hired to build it. The target market is mega-capital projects where the costs exceed tens of millions of pounds and project overruns were upwards of 40%.
 
Over my time working on ProCon, I had brought it from database-on-a-screen interface design to something that had a more considered approach to usability. I had worked with each product owner to visualize features and get approval of product and development before any programming work began. You know, standard sort of stuff. Several issues arose from this, I became a hero-designer which isn't good and the product team lacked the buy-in for the features we were developing. This lack of buy-in would cause gaps or bugs in the software since the team didn't understand why it was there and how it fit into the larger product.

To address the team's lack of buy-in and to help move through the ideation phase, I introduced a design sprint ceremony into the agile discovery process. Inspired from the [Google Design Sprint](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/overview) documentation,  different tasks were applied depending on the problems to be solved.

### Bring the team along on the journey, just don't name it

The team was alotted 3-5 days during the kickoff workshop to come up with ideas to address the problem by mapping out the user flow and highlighting pain points indicated either by the core problem, additional user feedback, or our own observations.
