I was brought to [Global Savings Group](https://www.global-savings-group.com/) to scale the newly created design system which was custom made for a subset of its product suite.

An external agency was hired to create the initial version of the design system and it was developed using the [MUI component library](https://mui.com/), which had made specific design decisions beyond what [Google Material Design](https://m2.material.io/) had established. It was the lack of understanding of those design decisions whiched caused a bit of a mess just as I was staring my new job. The result was that we were able to turn out rebranded products quickly, but that only consisted of about five or so features. 

We realized quickly when we wanted to extend our offering to include any additional features, we had to create lots of exceptions.
